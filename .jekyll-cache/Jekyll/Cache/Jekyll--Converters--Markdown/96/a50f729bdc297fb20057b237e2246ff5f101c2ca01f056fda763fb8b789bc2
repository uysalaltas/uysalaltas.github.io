I"À<p>The easiest way to add a nice look or functionality to your application developed with OpenGL is to use a GUI library. In this way, you will have tools that can be used while developing applications such as buttons, text fields or color picker. In this article, I talked about how the window created with OpenGL is rendered within the ImGUI window and how the window is scaled after rendering.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-framebuffer">Creating a framebuffer</h2>
<p>We need to create a copy of the scene created with OpenGL and keep this copy in a buffer. At this stage, the framebuffer comes to our aid. You can find a more detailed article about Framebuffer at https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Framebuffers. After creating framebuffer we have to attach to a texture for using it.</p>

<p>Lets create our framebuffer and bind it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-C++">glGenFramebuffers(1, &amp;fbo);
glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fbo);
</code></pre>
