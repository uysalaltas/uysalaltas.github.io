I"<p>There is no doubt that 3D printers make our lives easier. With the use of 3D printers, slicing programs that help transform virtual objects into reality are very important. We use open source slicers such as <a href="https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine">Cura</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r">Slic3r</a>, which are already performing well. But how does the algorithm behind this complex code base work? In this series, we will look for the answer to this question. We can examinate this question in 3 part.</p>
